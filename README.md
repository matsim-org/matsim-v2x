# matsim-v2x

A small example of how to use MATSim for simulations of vehicle-to-X communication.  

The approach in this repository uses pre-existing vehicle trajectories as input, i.e. it is _not_ running MATSim.

By default, this project uses the latest (pre-)release. In order to use a different version, edit `pom.xml`.

A recommended directory structure is as follows:
* `src` for sources
* `original-input-data` for original input data (typically not in MATSim format)
* `scenarios` for MATSim scenarios, i.e. MATSim input and output data.  A good way is the following:
  * One subdirectory for each scenario, e.g. `scenarios/mySpecialScenario01`.
  * This minimally contains a config file, a network file, and a population file.
  * Output goes one level down, e.g. `scenarios/mySpecialScenario01/output-from-a-good-run/...`.
  
  
### Import into eclipse

1. download a modern version of eclipse. This should have maven and git included by default.
1. `file->import->git->projects from git->clone URI` and clone as specified above.  _It will go through a 
sequence of windows; it is important that you import as 'general project'._
1. `file->import->maven->existing maven projects`

Sometimes, step 3 does not work, in particular after previously failed attempts.  Sometimes, it is possible to
right-click to `configure->convert to maven project`.  If that fails, the best thing seems to remove all 
pieces of the failed attempt in the directory and start over.

### Import into IntelliJ

`File -> New -> Project from Version Control` paste the repository url and hit 'clone'. IntelliJ usually figures out
that the project is a maven project. If not: `Right click on pom.xml -> import as maven project`.

### Java Version

The project uses Java 11. Usually a suitable SDK is packaged within IntelliJ or Eclipse. Otherwise, one must install a 
suitable sdk manually, which is available [here](https://openjdk.java.net/)

### Building and Running it locally

You can build an executable jar-file by executing the following command:

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

or on Windows:

```sh
mvnw.cmd clean package
```

This will download all necessary dependencies (it might take a while the first time it is run) and create a file `matsim-example-project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the top directory. This jar-file can either be double-clicked to start the MATSim GUI, or executed with Java on the command line:

```sh
java -jar matsim-example-project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
